OH Auto Statistical
===================

Fully automated flood estimation for UK catchments.

This package is a simple front-end for the OH `floodestimation` library for rapid estimation of flood flow rates. It 
works like this:

1. In a file explorer, right-click on a `.CD3` catchment file and click `Create OH Auto Statistical report`.
2. Open the generated report file containing full calculation details and results.

This package has been created to test the `floodestimation` library and develop its reporting outputs.
