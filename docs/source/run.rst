Usage
=====

OH Auto Statistical takes a **catchment descriptors (.CD3) file as input data**. The analyses are undertaken without any
further user input and a report file is generated containing the calculation details and results.

To undertake an analysis:

 1. Export a .CD3-file from the `FEH CD ROM <http://www.hydrosolutions.co.uk/products.asp?categoryID=4670>`_ and save
    it at the desired location.
 2. Locate the .CD3-file using Windows Explorer, right-click and select `Create OH Auto Statistical report`.
 3. A report is generated which has the same file name as the .CD3-file but ending with
    `Flood estimation report.yyyy-mm-dd.md`. This is a simple text file and can be opened with `notepad`.

.. note::
   The first time OH Auto Statistical is run, it will download a complete set of gauged catchment data from the
   `National River Flow Archive (NRFA) <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/nrfa/>`_ for pooled analyses. These data are subject
   to `terms and conditions <http://www.ceh.ac.uk/data/nrfa/data/data_terms.html>`_.
