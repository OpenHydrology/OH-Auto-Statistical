[COMMENTS]
STATION,'Essex' profile (modified Flat V Crump) weir with crest tapping. No spillway. Modest modular limit affected by weed growth. Naturalised flows 1969-1976. Minor adjustments needed to correct for artificial influences. RATING COMMENTS:Essex weir with VA rating for high flows. One rating applied across period of record. Some of the gaugings were based on float-runs and may not be reliable. Modular limit approximately 0.62m.
CATCHMENT,Predominantly rural, plus Braintree. Upper two-thirds of catchment Chalk, remainder London Clay (exposed in valleys), all overlain with Boulder Clay and glacial gravel. ARTIFICIAL INFLUENCES:. CATCHMENT CHANGES:No information available
Qmed Suitability,Some scatter in gaugings evident but QMED estimates are thought to be reasonable.
Pooling Suitability,Although gauged to within 2% of AMAX3, significant scatter and no gaugings above bank full reduces confidence in rating for high flows.
